# Contributing to Vaadin Portlet

We welcome quality patches that solve problems. A quality patch follows good coding practices - it’s easy to read and understand. For more complicated fixes or features, the change should be broken down into several smaller easy to understand patches.
Please keep the following in mind when contributing PRs to Vaadin Portlet:
 * All fixes should target the `master` branch.
 * Describe your changes: what did you change, why did you change it, how did you change it? 
 * Separate your changes: one change per commit, many small changes are easier to review.
 * Include a test to prove your patch works, or a benchmark if it’s a performance improvement.
 * Style-check your changes: it’s okay to have a separate commit to fix style issues.
 * Ensure you have Contributor Agreement signed up. This can be signed digitally in the code review system.
 * Create a pull request; it will then be reviewed by the Framework team, who will provide actionable feedback in a timely fashion if necessary. **Remember to check the "Allow edits from maintainers" so we can rebase the PR or make small changes if necessary**.
 * Respond to review comments: review comments are meant to improve the quality of the code by pointing out defects or readability issues.
 * Don't get discouraged - or impatient: reviewers are people too and will sometimes forget. Give them a friendly poke if you feel the PR has been forgotten about. 
 * Most PRs take a few iterations of review before they are merged.
